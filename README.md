EPA-2012-Residential-Exposure-SOPs
==================================

Configuration
-------------

To add the EPA 2102 Residential Exposure SOPs wizard to your Django project, simply put ``sop_calcs`` into your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` at settings module:

      INSTALLED_APPS = (
         ...
         'sop_calcs',
      )

You will need to install jQuery v1.7 and Bootstrap v2.0.2-v2.3.2 into the ``static`` folder to ensure all UI features work and feel as intended.
